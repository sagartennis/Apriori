# Apriori
Apriori principle allows us to prune all the supersets of an itemset which does not satisfy the minimum threshold condition for support. For example, if {Milk, Notebook} does not satisfy our threshold of minsup, an itemset with any item added to this will never cross the threshold too. The methodology that results is called the apriori algorithm
